                <p>
                    Machine Learning was founded in 2022. The academy was born out of frustration with the lack of focused electronic music courses that really delve deep into a partiuclar machines capabilities. Our goal is to create content for producers who really want to push their music to the next level. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From our Dublin studio we have created an extensive library of production tutorials and courses which range from focused workshops on specific pieces of hardware to general topics like mixing and mastering in Ableton Live. Our courses are structured so you can maximize your development of theortical knowledge, technical skills and creative abilities in a short space of time. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Our content is exclusively available online with a mixture of paid and free options. We offer courses for every skill level, from novices just starting on their journey to intermediate and advanced producers looking to learn new skills and further refine their sound.
