#### Latest Tutorials Section

To engage potential customers as soon as they land on the site, it was important to include links to the Machine Learning content on the home page. The latest tutorials section was chosen to appear first as this is free content and can be used to entice customers to other sections of the website. The tutorials section containts two more images which span the width of the page, containing a tutorial title and brief description.

## Features to Implement

In fututre updates to the website, I would like to: 

Embed videos in each tutorial and course page so users have an clear vision of what the content looks like on the front end of the website. 

Create slide show for tutorials section so it takes up less space on the index page and users can browse through the different tutorials by clicking on an arrow button located underneath the tutorial image. 

Add a checkout page where customers can select and pay for their chosen course directly on the webiste. 

Purchase an extended licence the [Ultra Brutalism](https://shop.studioinnate.com/product/ultra-brutalism/) font used to create the Machine Learning logo. This would would allow me intergrate into the website as text and use semantic markup.

# User Experience

## Wireframes

The design process for the website begun with creating wireframes to sketch the layout of the website. They were created in Adobe Photoshop and provided a basic design structure to work off when coding the website. I stuck to the basic structure when creating the website, but there was a lot of back and forth in the design process, particularly with the hero images, before I was happy with the final result.  

![index-wireframes img width=500 ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107034179/186139728-ff84a93f-06e7-4948-93b0-5dda373506df.png)

![courses-wireframes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107034179/186143284-623a739f-c7c4-417d-a236-89eafd5b1b2b.png)

<hr>

## Design

The website was designed with the intent of combining a striking visual look with functionality and uniformity being consist across the different sections of the website. 

I chose a color palette which combines purples & greys overlaying a light beige background. 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107034179/186390392-2d2926d9-cb4c-4d54-90f7-a3559549a6e5.jpeg" alt="palette" width="200"/>

Each page on the website contains the header and footer section which let users easily navigate to each section of the website. 

The hero images used on each page are striking, relevant and in keeping with the websites aesthetic. They are a combination of licenced images from Adboe stock and custome images created in Adboe Photoshop. 

The Machine Learning Logo was created in Adobe Photoshop and uses the [Ultra Brutalism](https://shop.studioinnate.com/product/ultra-brutalism/) font from Studio Inate. 

All headers through out the website use Myriad Pro Condensed which was licenced through Adobe Fonts. This a humanist sans-serif with an informal and welcoming aesthetic. 

For all paragraph content, I used Roboto Mono from Google fonts. This is a monospaced font, the same stlye which is used in all code editors and felt like the appropriate choice for this project. It contrasts the headers nicely and is easy on the eye.

# Testing

## Functionality Testing

Through out the process of building the website I tested it across different browsers to ensure it displayed properly. These included Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. 

I also periodically tested the website on a smart phone, tablet, small laptop and large monitor to ensure the websites' responsive design displayed correctly across a multitude of platforms. I also used Google Chrome's Dev Tools to test this functionality. 

I checked the contact form, and always re-enabled it after making any changes to ensure it worked correctly and sent all responses to the delegated email address.

## Unfixed Bugs

There were no remaining bugs at the time of deploymenet, each element on the website is functioning as it should be.

<hr>

# Deployment

I created the repository using the [Code Institute Gitpod Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

I selected "Use this template" and then created a new repository using the full template. 

Once in Github repository I then set up the development environment in Gitpod

I begun the website by creating an index.html page and css style sheet. 

I committed all updates through the development process, ensuring they were well defined and included a clear message describing the reason for each commit. 

The website is hosted on Github pages and can be found by navigated to the settings tab in the repoistory and then clicking on pages where you can find a link to the live website. 

Live link is available here: https://barry-greaves.github.io/machine-learning/index.html

# Credits 

## Content

The the majority of the code used for the website is original and created using what I learned in the Code Institute HTML and CSS Modules. Any additional sources are outlined below. 

### Supler Simple Dev - [HTML & CSS Full Course](https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc)

I used this resource to learn the principals of flexboxes and CSS grid which are used extensively throughout the website. 

### Code with Ania Kubów - [HTML Forms using Form Submit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4RQ38EoLds)

I used this tutorial to learn how to create a working HTML form using only HTML & CSS linking it to the free Form Submit service.  

### Angela Delise - [Responsive Navigation Bar Only CSS | Mobile First Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIzi9z8mrTk)

I used this tutorial to learn how to create a responsive nav bar that switched to a burger icon when the screen narrows to a max width 900px. I used a modified version of the code for the live website, but the principal of creating a checkbox to control the burger icon was taken from this tutorial. 

## Media

### Images

The images used for the hero images on the index, software & hardware courses pages courses were licenced from [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/).

The studio image of headphones used in the about section on the index page is from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

The images used for the hardware course, software and tutorials pages aswell as the courses selection grid were created in Adobe Photoshop. I used PNG images of various pieces of hardware downloaed from [Fav PNG](https://favpng.com/) and overlayed them onto created background images I created using the websites color palette.
