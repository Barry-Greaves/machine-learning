# Machine Learning - Project 1

This is the website for Machine Learning, an online electronic music academeny based in Dublin, Ireland. 

From their Dublin studio they have created an extensive library of production tutorials and courses which range from focused workshops on specific pieces of hardware to general topics like mixing and mastering in Ableton Live. Their courses are structured to maximize your development of theortical knowledge, technical skills and creative abilities in a short space of time.

The goal of this project was to build a creative & striking website which helps to create an indentity for the company as well as one which is easy to navigate, properly structured and responsive. 

The website was created using HTML and CSS.

# Features

### Header 

The header section appears on all pages of the website (apart from thankyou.html) and contains the Machine Learning logo positioned on the right and a nav menu with links to each part of the website on the left. The links in the nav menu change color to indicate to the user which section of the website they are currently browsing.

Using responsive CSS styling, the list items disappear when the screen reaches 900px in width and is replaced with a burger menu icon which generates a drop down list when clicked.
