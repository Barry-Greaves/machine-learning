# Machine Learning - Project 1

This is the website for Machine Learning, an online electronic music academeny based in Dublin, Ireland. 

From their Dublin studio they have created an extensive library of production tutorials and courses which range from focused workshops on specific pieces of hardware to general topics like mixing and mastering in Ableton Live. Their courses are structured to maximize your development of theortical knowledge, technical skills and creative abilities in a short space of time.

The goal of this project was to build a creative & striking website which helps to create an indentity for the company as well as one which is easy to navigate, properly structured and responsive. 

The website was created using HTML and CSS.

# Features

### Header 

The header section appears on all pages of the website (apart from thankyou.html) and contains the Machine Learning logo positioned on the left and a nav menu with links to each part of the website on the right. The links in the nav menu change color to indicate to the user which section of the website they are currently browsing.

Using responsive CSS styling, the list items disappear when the screen reaches 900px in width and is replaced with a burger menu icon which generates a drop down list when clicked.

### Home Page

This is the first page users will see when they enter the website and needs to serve two purposes. The first is to be visually appealing, presenting the companies aesthetic to gain the users attention. The second is provide information on who the company are and what they can offer to encourage the user to continue and explor all  other areas of the website. The home page is split into 4 sections; the hero image, the about section, the latest tutorials section and the latest courses section. 

#### Hero Image

The hero image covers the width of the page and is coded to be 70vh in height. It contains an visually striking studio set up overlayed with the Machine Learning logo and color scheme.

The about section contains essential information about Machine Learning, and what they offer to customers. It also contains links to relevant sections on the website.

#### Latest Tutorials Section

To engage potential customers as soon as they land on the site, it was important to include links to the Machine Learning content on the home page. The latest tutorials section was chosen to appear first as this is free content and can be used to entice customers to other sections of the website. The tutorials section containts two more images which span the widht of the page, containing a tutorial title and brief description.

#### Latest Courses Section

Finally, the latest courses section gives customers a look at the paid content offered on the website. It was constructed with CSS grid and displays an image and description of 3 courses.

### Course Info Pages

Each of the course info pages are layed out in the same way. They are split into 3 sections. First there is a hero image, beneath that there is a course info section and course offers section next to each other. This was created using a combination of flex boxes and CSS grid. 

#### Hero Image

Each of the hero images used displays the machine that is being taught in the course. For the hardware courses I layered png images of the machines being used over backgrounds created in photoshop which use the Machine Learning color scheme and stlying. There is text overlaying the hero images with a header displaying the course type and name.

#### Course Info & Offer Section

The main section of the page is split in two using a flex box with a ratio of 3:1. The left section then contains grids on top of divs to display the course info and the right section displays the different pricing options for each of the courses on offer.
